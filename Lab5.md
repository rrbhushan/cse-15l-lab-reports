# Lab Report 5
### Part 1


### Part 2
One very interesting thing I found out about was pertaining Github. I was introduced to Github and how to push/pull from it in one of my prior classes, however I never learned how to connect it to VS Code, which in turn made things a lot more difficult to work with and further having a fear towards it. So with finding out about Github desktop, it became a lot more easier to deal with Git and Github, making things much more organized than previously from directly using the terminal.
