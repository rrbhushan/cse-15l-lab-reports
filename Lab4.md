### Step 4

Keys pressed: ````<up>, <enter>````

The `ssh cs15lfa23sm@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command was 1 up in my search history while not logged in so I used the up arrow once to access it, followed by pressing enter to run the command.

### Step 5

Keys pressed: ````<control>, <r>, <g>, <i>, <t>, <space>, <c>, <l>, <enter>````

I used the Ctrl+R to be able to search through my history. Once I entered that history search mode, I typed in `git cl`, which autofilled the rest of the line to show `git clone git@github.com:rrbhushan/lab7.git` (shown by the first screenshot), to which I pressed enter to run the autofilled command in order to clone my fork (shown by the second screenshot). Also for this and later steps, I had ran all the commands in previous trials, which is why I am able to apply the Ctrl+R shortcut on those specific commands.

### Step 6

Keys pressed: ````<c>, <d>, <space>, <l>, <tab>, <enter>, <control>, <r>, <j>, <a>, <v>, <a>, <c>, <enter>, <control>, <r>, <j>, <a>, <v>, <a>, <space>, <->, <enter>````

I first used `cd l` to be able to go into the cloned repository, pressing tab and enter right after to autofill and enter the repository. I then used the Ctrl+R to be able to search through my history to search for `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` by typing `javac` then enter. Once that compiled, I used Ctrl+R again this time searching for `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` by typing `java -` then enter to run the tests.
